Setting up for the long run some local stuff:
This is an exemplar of using local GitHub program, then right clicking on repository name, opening in explore, and then drag and dropping files into the folder containing the .git folder name associated with the repository.  These are then sync'd with the appropriate icon click in GitHub local (up out arrow icon on top RHCorner).  At that point the repositories are sync'd with the external repository.
